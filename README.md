##Overview

• The project uses behavior data analysis methods to find out which factors cause customers to leave subscription services.
• The system establishes churn signals which enable businesses to develop retention strategies that increase customer lifetime value and generate stable revenue streams.

##Objectives

• The team will determine which percentage of customers stopped using the service.
• The team will find customer groups who have the highest chance of leaving.
• The team will investigate how customers leave the service based on their contract length and contract type.
• The team will examine how different prices affect customer departures.
• The team will calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for all customers.
• The team will present specific retention methods which can help the organization.

##Dataset

• The Telco Customer Churn Dataset includes:
• Customer demographics
• Subscription details
• Billing information
• Contract type
• Churn status

##Tools & Technologies Used

• The project uses Python programming language together with Pandas Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries and Jupyter Notebook software.

##Data Cleaning

• The team deleted customerID from the dataset.
• The team changed TotalCharges into a numeric format.
• The team solved the issue by completing missing information.
• The team transformed churn data into a binary format with two values (0/1).

##Exploratory Analysis

• The distribution of churn occurs throughout all customers.
• The study investigates how customers stop using the service based on their contractual agreements.
• The study investigates how customer tenure affects their tendency to churn.
• The study investigates how monthly billing amounts affect customer departures.
• The study examines how customers stay with the company when they reach different tenure milestones.

##Metrics Calculated

• The team calculated the overall customer turnover rate.
• The average period customers stayed with the service.
• The team calculated the total monthly revenue that customers generate.
• The team calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for all customers.

##Key Insights

• The month-to-month contract agreements experience the highest customer turnover rate.
• The majority of customers who leave do so during their initial twelve months.
• The study shows that customers who pay higher monthly fees have a greater chance of leaving the service.
• Customers who stay with the company for an extended period create much higher total value for the business.

##Business Recommendations

• The company needs to provide customers with price reductions when they select annual or long-term subscription packages.
• The company needs to create a better onboarding process which will last for the first three months.
• The company needs to start loyalty rewards programs which will give benefits to customers who stay with the company.
• The business needs to create retention programs which focus on customers who have a high risk of leaving.
